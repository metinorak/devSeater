# devSeater
you're not alone!

This project was thought due to a need: Improving programming skills using them on real life projects. The projects that is made for exercising not really motivates developers mostly. A developer may need to be working on projects he/she really believes to be motivated. But creating innovative ideas to work on cannot be found easily always. For this reason, the developer can wait until he/she found a new idea that can motivate him/her, and it may be late to improve the skills he/she owned.

With this project, it is intended to bring people who have close vision and similar skill sets together. This is a platform which has some basic social networking features such as posting, following, messaging, commenting and liking. For gathering people around a particular project, the platform has a characteristic solution. Users in the platform can create project pages and also create placeholders called “seater” that represents an imaginary person who has a skill set and features. The creator of a project page is the manager of the project and have full authority over the project. Other users can aspire “seaters” on project pages, and managers decide whether or not to assign them.
